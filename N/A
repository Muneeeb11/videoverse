The `auth/configuration-not-found` error is happening because the Firebase configuration keys are not present when the application code runs. My previous attempts to write these keys into the `.env` file have clearly failed.

Let's try a more direct approach. Instead of relying on the `.env` file, which seems to be the source of the problem, I will embed the Firebase configuration directly into the code where it is used. This is a reliable way to ensure the configuration is found.

I will modify `src/lib/firebase.ts` to include the configuration keys. This will permanently fix the authentication error.
